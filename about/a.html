          <h1>The life of Van Gogh.</h1>
          <p>
            Van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist artist. He is one of the
            most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.
            His artworks include oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and
            sketches. Van Gogh was born into an upper-middle-class family in
            1853 in the village of Groot-Zundert in the province of North
            Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the eldest son of
            Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and
            Anna Cornelia Carbentus. When he was just 16 years old, his father
            gave him a position at the art dealing firm Goupil & Cie in The
            Hague. This was a happy time for Vincent as he was able to explore
            his love for art without the pressure of having to produce saleable
            work. However, in 1876, after two years at Goupil's, Vincent was
            transferred to the company's branch in London, where he fell in love
            with his landlady's daughter, Elizabeth."Bessie" Reuters. Despite
            Vincent's objections, his father set him up with a position at the
            Paris branch of Goupil's in late 1873. Vincent was miserable in
            Paris and longed to return to the Netherlands. In 1879, after again
            becoming distraught over a love affair, Vincent quit his job at
            Goupil's and decided to become an artist.
